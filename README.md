## Binding keyboard keys

This is a script program showing how to bind computer keys. I added a visual effect to the script, but the script could be much simpler. In summary, it is very simple and gives **many possibilities without additional dependencies**. I will remind you that there are specialized libraries *keyboard*, *pynput* or *pygame*.

It is better if the tk window is active while testing the keyboard. Codes are read in the terminal, in the following order:

**event.keysym, event.keycode, event.char**
